//Implement for BlindZoo

1.divide Visitor from Zoo to interact

2.almost dead circulate to run the program

3.use String to receive the input and translate the commands
//getline(cin, Visitor.m_CmdVerb, ' ');
//getline(cin, Visitor.m_CmdNoun, '\n');

4.make the Beep to show the coodinate

5.create three status of result from command to express RIGHT, WRONG and Done

6.read to Map.txt for a map, even thought there's not Map.txt, get anything ROAD

7.randomly make animals in the road

8.if step back, it will show you because it has a two-dimension array to record it

9.some crack commands I added

10.new command is easy to add by modifying CVisitor.cpp and try to imitate the finished one

11.new animal is also easy to add by create CNewAnimal.h and CNewAnimal.cpp, all the code is almose the same as the finished one. And remember to #include"CNewAnimal.h"
