//Implement for MapEditer

1.load the image from the current path

2.call Frame() to ensure the entrance, exit and border

3.call Fill() to fill map to the full with WALL

4.call IsFull() to test if any EMPTY exists

5.call IsConnect() to try to get out of the map within 1000 steps
//the algorithm is from the old experiment and firstly go current right otherwise secondly go straight otherwise finally turn left

6.call Save() to save the map as Map.txt in current path only with '0' and '1'

7.use common dialog to open a txt and turn it into a map
//if load unsuccessfully, do nothing

8.call AlgorithmToMap() to invert the int array to my EBlock array

9.you can easily add a algorithm to built a 10*10 map and see the result

10.all the entrance, exit and border are setted not to be modified

11.not full is not allowed to save

12.not connect is also not allowed to save
